  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Christella Taguicana, and I am currently a sophomore at Dr. Richard A. Vladovic Harbor Teacher Preparation Academy. I am also a student that is enrolled in Dual Enrollment at Los Angeles Harbor College. I am interested in pursuing Computer Science and Business Communications & Economics at UC Berkeley. On this site, it shows a little bit about my education throughout high school, and some extracurriculars and hobbies that I do.

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <h3>What are your proudest personal and academic accomplishments during high school?</h3>
    <p>One of my proudest personal accomplishments during high school was becoming Key Club President. As a freshman, I did not think I would be able to get an officer position, especially since I did not succeed in middle school. However, as a sophomore, I was elected Key Club President. It is something that I am proud of because I love service, and being president of a club that I am passionate about makes me happy. Being able to serve my school and community also brings me joy that I cannot get anywhere else.</p>
    <p>My proudest academic accomplishment was getting a 4.0GPA for two years of high school. Because of the pandemic, I was not able to get the full high school experience. I had to experience the transition from in-person to online, and it ultimately took a toll on my mental health. However, I was able to overcome it and continue getting a 4.0GPA throughout freshmen and sophomore year.</p>
    <h3>What extracurricular activities (in or out of THS) have been most meaningful to you and why?</h3>
    <p>The extracurricular activity that has been most meaningful to me would be Tinikling (Filipino cultural dance) for Filipino Club. Joining Filipino Club made me feel more connected to my culture, and being a part of the Tinikling dance group gave me a family. Through Tinikling, I was able to connect with people in and out of my culture. I bonded with the people there and they have become a second family to me, and I could not be more grateful for them.</p>
    <h3> Is there anything unusual or unique about your family - cultural background, traditions, shared interests, and activities, family size, crises, etc.- that has had a significant impact on you?</h3>
    <p>Something unusual or unique about my family is our cultural background. My family immigrated from the Philippines, a third-world country and I was born here. As someone who is a descendant from a Filipino family, I am expected to meet the stereotypes brought upon me by society. I am expected to be smart, and work in a field that gains a lot of money. However, this had a significant impact on me and my mental health. Since then, I wasn't performing at my best, compared to how I could have performed. The applied amount of pressure has affected my grades negatively at one point. Furthermore, my family did not grow up in the best conditions, so we don't get the same amount of opportunities as others. The field that I am in interested in joining is populated with white males. Having to reach a goal that seems hefty in the field is challenging and adds a lot of negative pressure.</p>
    <h3>What are your hobbies outside of school?</h3>
    <p>Some of my hobbies outside of school would be volunteering and dancing. Volunteering and service has been a big part of my life and I have been doing service work since middle school. I was part of Dons & Donettes at Dodson Middle School, and I volunteered at my church. I also do Key Club and I am currently the president. Key Club has many service projects and events that I participate dance. Dancing has been a more recent hobby, but I fell in love with it. It allows me to express my emotions in a way that words cannot.</p>
    <h3>What are you considering as your major in college and why?  Do you have any experience that will prepare you for that major?</h3>
    <p>I am considering Computer Science as my major in college because computer science and technology is used in almost everything. There are many jobs that can be found with a computer science major, and because of this, I can figure out which job works best for me. I have experience that will prepare me for this major because I am currently taking Exploring Computer Science at school. I am in Robotics and I am also in the Technology Student Association club at HTPA. </p>
