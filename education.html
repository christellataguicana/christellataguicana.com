  <h2>Dr. Richard A. Vladovic Harbor Teacher Preparation Academy & Los Angeles Harbor College</h2>
    <p>As a tenth grader at DRAVHTPA, I have accomplished quite a lot. I have gotten two Principal's Honor Roll awards, and straight As for the past two years. I managed to maintain these grades while taking multiple Dual Enrollment classes at Los Angeles Harbor College and participating in multiple clubs and activities. In ninth grade, I took three college classes and was in four clubs. In tenth grade, I had to drop one club as I ranked higher in the other three. I am currently taking three college classes as well, and I am participating in many extracurriculars both at school, church, and other programs.
